# Restaurant-Finder

PERN(PostgresSQL,Express,React,Node.js)
You need to have PostgresSQL in order to run this project locally,also i have the file "db.sql" when i have saved all the schemas ive used,copy them and run them to the terminal in order to create the same DB.

-UI styling:Bootstrap
-State menagment:createContext  
-Run server in terminal -->cd server than npm start
-Run project in local machine --> cd client than npm start

You can create restaurant,update it also delete.Ive includet a star rating for each restaurant and you can have a view of each restaurant with star rating and coments.
